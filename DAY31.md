# 🚀 Day 31 of 100 Days of DevOps

## 📌 Topic: CI/CD Concepts – Continuous Integration, Delivery & Deployment

---

## 📖 What I Learned Today

Today, I began my deep dive into **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment)** – a core part of modern DevOps practices.

### ✅ **CI/CD Explained**

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Continuous Integration (CI)** | Automating the process of integrating code changes frequently, testing and validating each change. |
| **Continuous Delivery (CD)** | Automating the delivery of code to staging or production-like environments. Deployment is still manual. |
| **Continuous Deployment (CD)** | Fully automating the release of code to production after passing tests – no manual approval needed. |

## 🧠 Key Concepts I Explored

- **CI/CD pipeline stages**:
  - Code → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor
- **Benefits of CI/CD**:
  - Faster feedback loops
  - Reduced bugs in production
  - Improved collaboration and confidence
- **Popular CI/CD tools**:
  - GitHub Actions
  - Jenkins
  - GitLab CI
  - CircleCI
  - TravisCI

## 🧪 Hands-on Practice Plan

Starting tomorrow, I’ll begin practical work using **GitHub Actions** to:

- Automate testing
- Lint code
- Build and push Docker images
- Trigger workflows on `push`, `pull_request`, etc.

## 🔥 What's Next?

🔜 **Day 32**: Create a GitHub Actions workflow to run a script or test!
