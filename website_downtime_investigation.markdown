# Website Goes Down After Deploymentâ€”How Do You Investigate?

When a website goes down after deployment, a systematic approach is crucial to identify and resolve the issue quickly. Below is a step-by-step guide to investigate and troubleshoot the problem effectively.

## Step 1: Verify the Issue
- **Confirm the downtime**: Check if the website is down for all users or specific regions. Use tools like **Pingdom**, **UptimeRobot**, or a simple `curl` command to verify.
  ```bash
  curl -I https://yourwebsite.com
  ```
- **Check error messages**: Visit the website in a browser or use developer tools to inspect network requests for HTTP status codes (e.g., 500, 404, 502).
- **Reproduce the issue**: Attempt to access the website from different devices, browsers, or networks to confirm the scope.

## Step 2: Check Server and Application Logs
- **Access server logs**: Look at logs for the web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) or application server (e.g., Node.js, Django, Rails).
  - For Nginx: `/var/log/nginx/error.log`
  - For Apache: `/var/log/apache2/error.log`
- **Application logs**: Check for stack traces, unhandled exceptions, or resource issues (e.g., memory leaks, database connection errors).
- **Cloud provider logs**: If hosted on AWS, Azure, or GCP, check their respective logging dashboards (e.g., AWS CloudWatch).

## Step 3: Review Recent Deployment Changes
- **Check version control**: Review the latest commits or pull requests in your Git repository to identify changes made in the deployment.
  ```bash
  git log --oneline --since="1 day ago"
  ```
- **Compare configurations**: Ensure environment variables, `.env` files, or configuration files (e.g., `nginx.conf`, `Dockerfile`) are consistent between environments.
- **Rollback if needed**: If the issue is tied to the recent deployment, consider rolling back to the previous stable version.
  ```bash
  git revert <commit-hash>
  ```

## Step 4: Investigate Infrastructure
- **Server health**: Check CPU, memory, and disk usage on the server.
  ```bash
  top
  df -h
  ```
- **Network issues**: Verify DNS resolution, load balancer configuration, or firewall rules.
  ```bash
  dig yourwebsite.com
  ```
- **Database connectivity**: Ensure the database is running and accessible. Check for connection timeouts or query errors.
  ```sql
  SELECT 1;
  ```

## Step 5: Check External Dependencies
- **Third-party services**: Verify APIs, CDNs, or external services (e.g., payment gateways, authentication providers) are operational.
- **Service status pages**: Check the status pages of dependencies (e.g., AWS, Stripe, Cloudflare).
- **API testing**: Use tools like Postman or `curl` to test external API endpoints.

## Step 6: Monitor and Communicate
- **Set up monitoring**: Use tools like **New Relic**, **Datadog**, or **Prometheus** to monitor application performance and detect issues proactively.
- **Notify stakeholders**: Inform the team and users about the outage via status pages or communication channels (e.g., Slack, email).
- **Document findings**: Log the root cause, resolution steps, and preventive measures for future reference.

## Step 7: Prevent Future Downtime
- **Implement CI/CD checks**: Add automated tests, linters, and staging environments to catch issues before deployment.
- **Use health checks**: Configure health endpoints (e.g., `/health`) to monitor application status.
- **Set up alerts**: Configure alerts for critical metrics like response time, error rates, or server resource usage.
