# Case Study: Handling a Failed Deployment



## Investigation Process
1. **Confirmed the Issue**: I immediately accessed the website and reproduced the error, confirming that the checkout endpoint was returning HTTP 500 errors. I used `curl` to verify:
   ```bash
   curl -I https://example.com/checkout
   ```
   The response showed a 500 status code, indicating a server-side issue.

2. **Checked Logs**: I accessed the application logs on our AWS EC2 instance via AWS CloudWatch. The logs revealed a stack trace pointing to a null pointer exception in the new payment processing module, caused by an unhandled edge case where the payment gateway returned an unexpected response format.

3. **Reviewed Code Changes**: Using Git, I checked the recent commits to identify changes related to the payment feature:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --since="2 hours ago"
   ```
   The issue stemmed from a new API integration that assumed a consistent response structure, which failed when the payment gateway returned an error.

4. **Collaborated with the Team**: I notified the team via Slack and set up a quick call to discuss the issue. We confirmed the root cause was a lack of proper error handling in the new code.

## Actions Taken
1. **Rolled Back the Deployment**: To restore service quickly, we rolled back to the previous stable version:
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   ```
   After redeploying, the checkout page was functional again within 10 minutes.

2. **Fixed the Issue**: In a staging environment, I added error handling to account for unexpected API responses and wrote unit tests to cover edge cases. The updated code was:
   ```python
   try:
       response = payment_gateway.process(data)
       if not response.get("status"):
           raise PaymentError("Invalid response from gateway")
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Payment processing failed: {str(e)}")
       return {"status": "error", "message": "Payment processing unavailable"}
   ```

3. **Retested and Redeployed**: After passing tests in the staging environment, we redeployed the fixed version during the next maintenance window.

## Preventive Measures
- **Added CI/CD Checks**: We updated our CI/CD pipeline to include integration tests for the payment gateway, ensuring edge cases were covered.
- **Improved Monitoring**: We configured alerts in Datadog for specific error patterns, like null pointer exceptions, to catch issues faster.
- **Post-Mortem Documentation**: We held a post-mortem meeting and documented the incident in Confluence, outlining the root cause, resolution, and preventive steps.

## Lessons Learned
This experience highlighted the importance of robust error handling and thorough testing for external dependencies. It also reinforced the value of a quick rollback strategy and clear communication during incidents.
